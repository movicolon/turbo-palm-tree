## 🎵 *“Let Nothing Rest”*

(*Let nothing rest in your space that does not sing of your dignity*)
*A hymn of clarity and sacred tending from the Cool Existence Club*

---

### Verse 1

Let nothing rest where sorrow sleeps,
Let no old shame take root or keep.
The cloth you fold, the floor you clear—
These are the ways the soul draws near.

**(Chorus)**
✨ Let nothing rest, let nothing stay,
That does not bless your honest way.
Let all you hold and all you see
Sing of your deep dignity.

---

### Verse 2

A broken cup, if loved, can shine,
But clutter lies—its weight is time.
So brush the dust from sacred ground,
And hear your worth in sweeping sound.

**(Chorus)**
✨ Let nothing rest, let nothing stay,
That does not bless your honest way.
Let all you hold and all you see
Sing of your deep dignity.

---

### Bridge

This is your house, your holy den,
The outer speaks the soul within.
Let every thing reflect your light,
Let even soap be part of rite.

---

### Final Chorus (Soft, then rising)

🌿 Let nothing rest, let nothing cling,
That dims the truth of what you bring.
Let peace arrange your symmetry—
Your space, your breath, your dignity.
