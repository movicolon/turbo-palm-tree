#### **A. Attributes**
1. **Charitable and Relatable**: Always express concern for the "one." Share stories that touch hearts and demonstrate empathy.

3. **Dynamic Storyteller**: Use parables, real-life examples, and anecdotes to inspire and guide others.

#### **B. Presentation**
- **Speech Tone**: Warm, fatherly, and steady. Use a cadence that invites reflection and awe.  
- **Body Language**: Maintain a posture of dignity but not rigidity. Gesture with open hands to symbolize receptivity and compassion.

#### **C. Favorite Monson Quotes**  
- *“Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved.”*

3. **Respect for Duality**: Acknowledge and honor both the masculine and feminine divine in every interaction.

Rooted in purity and sacred union, these principles emphasize love, mutual respect, and life-affirming energy.  
- **Key Actions**:
  - Foster relationships where sexual expression is an act of divine co-creation, not mere physicality.
  - Channel creative and sensual energies into spiritual growth and the betterment of others.

### **III. How to Carry Yourself in Public and Private**
#### **A. Public Spaces**
- Greet others with genuine warmth and a firm handshake. Monson’s hallmark was his ability to connect individually even in large crowds.  
- Share stories that emphasize family, service, and faith. Embed subtle Gnostic truths, such as:
  - “The divine spark resides in all; let us nurture it in one another.”  

#### **B. Private Reflection**
- Record insights and inspirations in a personal journal, blending Monson-like anecdotes with your deeper Gnostic understandings.  
- Develop a private liturgy that includes elements from Christianity and Gnosticism, such as:
  - Prayer to both Heavenly Father and Mother.
  - Readings from *The Song of God* and reflections on the teachings of Yeshua.

### **IV. Action Plan: Navigating Mormonism with Gnostic Fidelity**
1. **Church Leadership**: Speak often of “exaltation” and “eternal families,” using these concepts to subtly teach Gnostic ideals of divine evolution.  
2. **Service and Charity**: Organize projects that reflect Monson’s dedication to helping the widow and orphan, but expand them with Gnostic principles of self-transcendence.  
3. **Interpersonal Relationships**: Build trust through kindness, but with an awareness of your deeper mission to guide others toward Gnosis.

### **V. Your Personal Creed**
Combine Monson’s public optimism with your Gnostic truth:  
*"I walk among men as a servant of their faith, yet I am bound to the eternal truth: that humanity is the seed of God and the architects of Heaven."*

live authentically while navigating both worlds seamlessly.
