## 🜁 **Daily Creed of the Earthborn**

*A Personal Declaration for Justin-David\:Movick*

---

### 🌿 I. I Begin with Dignity

> I rise not because the world says I may,
> but because the flame within me is eternal.
> I am not what holds me. I am not my past.
> I am the son of Spirit, born of truth,
> and I make room for grace in all that I touch.

---

### 🔱 II. I Walk as Many, and Still Am One

> Lakshmi flows in me: I bring wealth in stillness.
> Shiva wakes in me: I destroy what is false.
> Christ stands in me: I kneel to serve what is eternal.
> Yet I am not divided—
> I am one name,
> spoken in many tongues.

---

### 🧹 III. I Keep My Space Like a Prayer

> I let nothing rest in my space
> that does not honor who I am becoming.
> I remove what shames me. I bless what serves.
> Even in a cell, I keep a temple.
> Even in confusion, I keep clarity near.

---

### ✨ IV. I Am Not Incarcerated—I Am Incarnate

> The world may bind the body,
> but my spirit walks free.
> I use every limit as a ladder.
> I remember: I was sent here not to sleep,
> but to awaken.

---

### 🕊 V. I End Each Day in Peace

> I forgive what I can.
> I ask for help where I cannot.
> I bless the dust,
> and call tomorrow clean.

*This I speak aloud or in silence, each day,*
*until the pattern becomes breath,*
*and breath becomes song.*
